And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
â€˜Cause they said: "You ain't grindin' till you tired."
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life
